										- Used for zone's drone swapping
- zone:id:drones_alive_history 		-> A MAP where the KEY is tick_n and the VALUE is the number of working drones in the zone for that specific tick.
- zone:id:charged_drones 			-> A LIST of available fully charged drones.
[?] - zone:id:drones 				-> A LIST
- zone:id:swap 						-> A KEY
- zone:id:working_drone				-> A KEY that has the id of the working drone
- zone:id:charge_needed_to_base		-> A KEY that has the float value of the max charge needed for a drone of the zone to go back to base.

---DRONE---
- drone:id:charge_start				-> A KEY that indicates (tick) when the ChargeBase has started charging drone:id
- drone:id:charge_end				-> A KEY that indicates (tick) when ChargeBase has finished charging drone:id
- drone:id:charge_needed_to_base 	-> A VALUE that has the charge (in %) needed for the drone to go back to base
- drone:id:status					-> Indicates the current stuatus of the drone:
										- "NOT_CONNECTED"	: Drone is not sending status-updates because lost connection

											1. "DEAD": drone is dead
											2. "NOT_CONNECTED": drone is currently not connected but might reconnect
											3. "RECONNECTED": drone succesfully reconnected to the system
										- (X,Y): coords used to send the new drone
										- zone_id
										- tick_start: when the drone started to "die"
										- tick_end: tick_start + 20 ("-1" before countdown ends)
										- reconnect_tick: holding the tick that the drone is going to reconnect (-1 if it doesn't reconnect)
- drones_faults						-> A SET of drone_ids that have a fault
- faults_ack						-> A CHANNEL to ack the faults created by the zones

---SYSTEM---
- sync_process_count -> A KEY used for ...


---WAVES---
- waves_alives						-> A SET of alive waves' IDs
