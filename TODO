 ☐ Disconnected fault state
 ☐ Dead fault state
 ☐ High consumption state
 ☐ Drone has 0% charge and dies
     Check if charge is 0%, if true send to Dead state
 ✔ Reconnected fault state @done (24-09-23 18:37)
 
 ☐ Correct final charging state: wave must die => correct simulation duration (conditions)
 ☐ DC "checked" calculations
 ☐ Check when to spawn wave
 ✔ Wave constructor using recycled drones @done (24-09-23 18:18)
 ✔ Fix syncing with Redis @done (24-09-23 18:33)
     ✔ With named_semaphores implemented Redis' use for sync (in process init) is not needed @done (24-09-23 18:33)

 ☐ WaveCoverageMonitor
 ☐ AreaCoverageMonitor
 ☐ TimeToReadData => SystemPerformance
 ☐ Fix any older monitor for the new implementation
