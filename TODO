 ☐ Test if a synced implementation of the wave-threads is fast enough to simulate thousands of ticks of a small amount of time
     - We lose performances by syncing threads but DC will not have unsynced data therfore writing data to DB should be faster
     - An unsynced approach will be faster for the wave-threads but DC still needs to parse all of the data
     - Consumer groups can be used in DC to parse the data and keep up with large amount of data uploaded by the threads
 ☐ Implement utility function for Redis timeouts


 Drones FST:
     ✔ Correct movement to left side @done (24-09-17 17:25)
         Start from (0, 0) and move to (-2990, Y), in diagonal where needed
     ☐ Start in Idle state
         Tick 0 drones are in (0, 0)
     ☐ Implement fault states
