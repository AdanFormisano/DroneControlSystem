 ☐ Test if a synced implementation of the wave-threads is fast enough to simulate thousands of ticks of a small amount of time
     - We lose performances by syncing threads but DC will not have unsynced data therfore writing data to DB should be faster
     - An unsynced approach will be faster for the wave-threads but DC still needs to parse all of the data
     - Consumer groups can be used in DC to parse the data and keep up with large amount of data uploaded by the threads
 ☐ Implement utility function for Redis timeouts
