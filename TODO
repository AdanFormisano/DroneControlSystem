 ☐ Script:
     ☐ Default show ticks of DCS
 ☐ Entry with state CHARGING_COMPLETED is missing from DB
     Currently when a drone has finished charging is added to a set on Redis, but no entry in the DB is added
     => we have no actual representation of a drone finishing charging in the DB

 ✔ Debug case where charge is 0% and drone should go to DEAD @done (24-09-30 15:23)
 ✔ High consumption state @done (24-09-25 22:15)
     ✔ Drone has 0% charge and dies @done (24-09-25 22:15)
         Check if charge is 0%, if true send to Dead state
 ✔ Reconnected fault state @done (24-09-23 18:37)
 ✔ Disconnected fault state @done (24-09-23 21:14)
 ✔ Dead fault state @done (24-09-23 21:14)

============================================= 
 ✔ Debug case where charge is 0% and drone should go to DEAD
 ✔ Consider encreasing High_consumption factor (at least 1.5x)
 ☐ Find a way to exit everything even if tick number in DB is slightly less then 5999 aka number of total tick
 ☐ Create separate process for monitors
 ☐ Implement CORRECTLY timeout features throughout the project to signal a "blocked" state
 ☐ Debug why DEAD is present twice in the DB

 ✔ Consider increasing High_consumption factor (at least 1.5x) @done (24-09-30 12:07)
 ✔ Correctly terminate the simulation @done (24-09-25 18:15)
     ✔ Check if DB has all the simulated ticks @done (24-09-25 18:15)
 ✔ DC "checked" calculations @done (24-09-25 18:00)
 ✔ Check when to spawn wave @done (24-09-25 16:06)
 ✔  Kill waves @done (24-09-24 14:58)
     ✔ Correct final charging state: wave must die => correct simulation duration (conditions) @done (24-09-24 14:58)
 ✔ Wave constructor using recycled drones @done (24-09-23 18:18)
 ✔ Fix syncing with Redis @done (24-09-23 18:33)
    ✔ With named_semaphores implemented Redis' use for sync (in process init) is not needed @done (24-09-23 18:33)

=============================================
 ☐ TimeToReadData => SystemPerformance
     ☐ Create input for message_queue
 ☐ DroneChargeMonitor
     ☐ Fix query for drones that arrived at base
     ☐ Fix query for exploded drones
 ☐ CoverageMonitor
     ☐ WaveCoverageMonitor
     ☐ AreaCoverageMonitor
     ☐ Change DEAD state to "Empty" Drone => DB will have entries for dead drones that the monitors can analyze (for the duration of the wave life)
     ☐ When a drone is WORKING and then disconnects the monitor should detected it as an issue
     ☐ Output should be the coords that the drone is not covering anymore (change also in monitor db)
         For each tick a set of coords need to be covered. If the drone dies the coords

 ✔ RechargeTimeMonitor @done (24-09-23 21:18)
