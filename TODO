 ☐ High consumption state
     ☐ Drone has 0% charge and dies
         Check if charge is 0%, if true send to Dead state

============================================= 
 ☐ DC "checked" calculations
 ☐ Correctly terminate the simulation
     ☐ Check if DB has all the simulated ticks

 ✔ Check when to spawn wave @done (24-09-25 16:06)
 ✔  Kill waves @done (24-09-24 14:58)
     ✔ Correct final charging state: wave must die => correct simulation duration (conditions) @done (24-09-24 14:58)
