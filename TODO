 ☐ Disconnected fault state
 ☐ Reconnected fault state
 ☐ Dead fault state
 ☐ High consumption state
 
 ☐ Wave constructor using recycled drones
 ☐ Correct final charging state: wave must die => correct simulation duration (conditions)
 ☐ DC "checked" calculations
 ☐ Check when to spawn wave
 ☐ Fix syncing with Redis
     ☐ With named_semaphores implemented Redis' use for sync (in process init) is not needed

 ☐ WaveCoverageMonitor
 ☐ AreaCoverageMonitor
 ☐ TimeToReadData => SystemPerformance
 ☐ Fix any older monitor for the new implementation
